I have recently completed some work for a local charity supporting their rollout of SharePoint to replace an old fileshare. This work reminded me how confusing SharePoint can be for new users, especially when it comes to using it to replace a traditional file server. Out of the box, SharePoint has some fantastic benefits over a fle share, such as automatic file versioning, soft deletion support with the multi-stage recycle bin and the ability to easily access and share documents without needed a VPN. But if you just continue to use SharePoint in the same way you did with a fileshare you are missing out on loads of additional capability. 

In this short series of articles I am going to outline three ways you can improve your use of SharePoint to level up document management within your intranet or team site. I am going to start with making use of metadata and leveraging this to create tailored views to help users find the relevant information quickly. In part 2 we will discuss how searchability and consistency can be improved with the addition of Site Columns and Content Types. Then finally part 3 will introduce Document Sets to keep related documents together and enable them to share metadata. By the end of this series you will be able to design a scable and searchable document management strategy making the best use of SharePoint features and you'll be able to make all these changes without your SharePoint admin being involved. 

So let's kick-off with document library metadata, what is it and why might you want to use it?
